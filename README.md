# Deep Clean

Deep Clean watches a room and flags all surfaces as they are touched for special attention on the next cleaning to help prevent the spread of contagious disease.

One use case would be in a hospital room.  When a patient checks out, the cleaning service could view all surfaces that need special attention on a screen in the room.
